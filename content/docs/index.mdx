I initially had all my docs on a seperate <a href="https://snippets.remcostoeten.com" target="_blank">site</a> which was build using ` Nextra` which is a ` MDX` framework powered by `NextJS` .

These docs here are integrated into the main `NextjJS` app router repo and build using `contentlayer` which uses `markdown` . Probably a little less performant than the initial Nextra site but fun nonetheless.
